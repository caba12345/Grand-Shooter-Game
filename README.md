# Grand Shooter

Grand Shooter is a simple 2D shooting game developed in C# using Windows Forms. In this game, the player controls a character armed with a bow and arrow, and the objective is to survive as long as possible while shooting down attacking lions. The game features health and ammo management, as well as scoring based on the number of lions defeated.
